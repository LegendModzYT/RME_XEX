To use this just Inject the GSC you want to inject into open memory for example I use `0x40300000`.

Once this is done open the `RME_XEX` project and edit the `GSC pointer` to be for the GSC File you want to override.

Then set the `fileSize` to the size of the GSC file you injected.

Go in game, obviously after injecting the GSC, and Launch the xex you built in the `RME_XEX` project.

You can find most of the GSC Files in the pastebin below.
