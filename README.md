To use this just Inject the GSC you want to open memory i use 0x40300000

Once you done this open and project and edit the GSC pointer to be for the GSC File you want to override

Then set the fileSize to the size of the GSC file you injected

Go ingame and Launch the xex

you can find most if not all the GSC files
